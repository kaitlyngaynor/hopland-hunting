Exploration of Hopland hunter GPS data for McInturff et al forthcoming

For Alex - if you are interested in running any of this code, it should be possible if you just pull the "Data" folder from the "R_for_Alex" Dropbox folder that we both shared. I'm just working with those raw data thus far. (but see issue 3 https://github.com/kaitlyngaynor/hopland-hunting/issues/3)
